### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### **Component Architecture**
```typescript
// Enhanced AvatarController with lip sync
<AvatarController
  emotion="HAPPY"
  speaking={true}
  lipSyncSource="microphone" // or 'text' or 'playback'
  speechText="Hello world"
  onLipSyncUpdate={(state) => console.log(state)}
/>

// TTS with lip sync
const { speak, stop, isPlaying } = useTTSLipSync();
await speak("Hello world", { rate: 0.9, pitch: 1.0 });
```

#### **Lip Sync Sources**
- **Microphone**: `lipSyncSource="microphone"` - Real-time voice analysis
- **Text**: `lipSyncSource="text"` - TTS synchronized lip sync  
- **Playback**: `lipSyncSource="playback"` - Audio file analysis
